### What I learned

I learned Im a total noob still with css and JS, I still have a lot to learn, and I should keep going its hard, but hard thing have their prises.

I also learned to use some css properties in a new way like widths and positions.

### Continued development

I really want to be a Pro in JS, I use it so little in this project, I was viewing some websites that had crazy amount of JS, I at least want to understand and decode that.

I had to learn some more about responsive layouts and some css properpeties, and how to google things properly when im lost, I use to code in python and googling things there seemed a lot easier or just I just lost the ability, anyways I should get better at it.
